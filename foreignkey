A company wants to manage its employees and their respective departments. Each employee must belong to a department. If a department is deleted, all employees in that department should also be removed automatically.
Tasks:
1. Create the Departments Table
Each department has a unique ID (DepartmentID).
The department name must be unique.
The department name cannot be NULL.
2. Create the Employees Table
Each employee has a unique ID (EmployeeID).
Each employee has a name and salary, both cannot be NULL.
Each employee must be assigned to a department (DepartmentID), which is a FOREIGN KEY referencing Departments(DepartmentID).
If a department is deleted, all employees in that department should also be deleted.
3. Insert Sample Data
Insert at least 3 departments.
Insert at least 5 employees (make sure at least two employees belong to the same department).
4. Implement Query Constraints (Without Using JOIN)
Write a query to list all employees and their department names (without using JOIN).
Write a query to update an employee's department.
Try deleting a department and observe what happens to the employees under that department.
